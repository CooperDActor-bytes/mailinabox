# IMAP search with lucene via solr
# --------------------------------
#
# By default dovecot uses its own Squat search index that has awful performance
# on large mailboxes. Dovecot 2.1+ has support for using Lucene internally but
# this didn't make it into the Ubuntu packages, so we use Solr instead to run
# Lucene for us.
#
# Solr runs as a Jetty process. The dovecot solr plugin talks to solr via its
# HTTP interface, searching indexed mail and returning results back to dovecot.

source setup/functions.sh # load our functions
source /etc/mailinabox.conf # load global vars

# Install packages and basic configuation

# Fix Logging
# Due to the new systemd security permissions placed when running jetty.
# The log file directory at /var/log/jetty9 is reset to jetty:jetty
# at every program start.  This causes syslog to fail to add the
# rsyslog filtered output to this folder.  We will move this up a
# directory to /var/log/ since solr-jetty is quite noisy.

# Remove package config file since it points to a folder that
# it does not have permissions to, and is also too far down the
# /etc/rsyslog.d/ order to work anyway.
