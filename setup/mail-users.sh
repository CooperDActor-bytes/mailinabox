# User Authentication and Destination Validation
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# This script configures user authentication for Dovecot
# and Postfix (which relies on Dovecot) and destination
# validation by quering an Sqlite3 database of mail users. 

source setup/functions.sh # load our functions
source /etc/mailinabox.conf # load global vars

# ### User and Alias Database

# The database of mail users (i.e. authenticated users, who have mailboxes)
# and aliases (forwarders).

db_path=$STORAGE_ROOT/mail/users.sqlite

# Create an empty database if it doesn't yet exist.
if [ ! -f $db_path ]; then
	echo Creating new user database: $db_path;
	echo "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, password TEXT NOT NULL, extra, privileges TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '');" | sqlite3 $db_path;
	echo "CREATE TABLE aliases (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, source TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, destination TEXT NOT NULL);" | sqlite3 $db_path;
fi

# ### User Authentication

# Disable all of the built-in authentication mechanisms. We formerly uncommented
# the line to include auth-sql.conf.ext but we no longer use that.
sed -i "s/#*\(\!include auth-.*.conf.ext\)/#\1/"  /etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-auth.conf

# Legacy: Delete our old sql conf files.
rm -f /etc/dovecot/conf.d/auth-sql.conf.ext /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext

# Specify how the database is to be queried for user authentication (passdb)
# and where user mailboxes are stored (userdb).
#
# The user part is easy. The mailbox path and Unix system user are the same
# for all mail users, modulo string substitution that Dovecot handles.
#
# For passwords, we would normally have Dovecot query our mail user database
# directly. The way to do that is commented out below. Instead, in order to
# support TOTP one time passwords, we will use a custom system that hooks
# into the Mail-in-a-Box management daemon.

#       args = /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext

# and then write to `/etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf.ext` (and chmod 0600):
#
#    driver = sqlite
#    connect = $db_path
#    default_pass_scheme = SHA512-CRYPT
#    password_query = SELECT email as user, password FROM users WHERE email='%u';

# SQL statement to rewrite an email address if an alias is present.
# Aliases have precedence over users, but that's counter-intuitive for
# catch-all aliases ("@domain.com") which should *not* catch mail users.
# To fix this, not only query the aliases table but also the users
# table, i.e. turn users into aliases from themselves to themselves.
# If there is both an alias and a user for the same address either
# might be returned by the UNION, so the whole query is wrapped in
# another select that prioritizes the alias definition.
