# 3) The stopped services are restarted.
# 5) STORAGE_ROOT/backup/after-backup is executd if it exists.

	# In an older version of this script, duplicity was called
	# such that it did not encrypt the backups it created (in
	# backup/duplicity), and instead openssl was called separately
	# after each backup run, creating AES256 encrypted copies of
	# each file created by duplicity in backup/encrypted.
	#
	# We detect the transition by the presence of backup/duplicity
	# and handle it by 'dupliception': we move all the old *un*encrypted
	# duplicity files up out of the backup/duplicity directory (as
	# backup/ is excluded from duplicity runs) in order that it is
	# included in the next run, and we delete backup/encrypted (which
	# duplicity will output files directly to, post-transition).
	#
	# This achieves two things:
	# 1. It preserves the pre-transition unencrypted backup files
	# within the encrypted backups we will immediately create, so
	# that they are kept until the next full backup is triggered.
	# (it is because those backups will be encrypted that we take
	# the old *un*encrypted backups, not the duplicates encrypted
	# with openssl).
	# 2. It results in backup_status() being called on a non-existant
	# backup/encrypted directory, which will trigger a full backup
	# (though duplicity ought to do one anyway as it ought not
	# recognise the old openssl encrypted .enc files, if we *had*
	# left them there). More to the point it clears out those .enc
	# files which are now redundant, thereby gaining disk space and
	# preventing backup_status() getting terribly confused by their
	# presence.
	#
	# A note about disk use:
	# At no point in the transition will we use more disk space than
	# was used pre-transition, because by deleting the openssl
	# encrypted duplicates we decrease by more* than half the disk
	# space used, while the addition by 'dupliception' of the old
	# *un*encrypted backups takes less space than we gained from
	# dropping the openssl encrypted duplicates.
	#
	# A note about the status page post-upgrade but pre-transition:
	# Between the point that the new code is deployed and when the first
	# daily backup is run, there will be a subtle change in the
	# behaviour of the web control panel's backup status page, in that
	# it will only sum the size of the encrypted backups when reporting
	# the total size on disk i.e. it will not consider the unencrypted
	# originals.

	# accounting for more than half of the space used.
